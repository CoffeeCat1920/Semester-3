** Evaluation of expression by stack
*** Infix
*** Polish
**** Prefix
**** Postfix
*** Evaluation
The postfix expression is scanned from left to right.
Oprand are pushed into the memory stack.
When it encounter an operator the top two oprands are poped.
The operter is applied and the answer is pushed into the stack.
*** Infix -> Postfix
* MISSED
** Types of qeues
1. Simple
2. Circular
** Queu delete
** Queu Add
