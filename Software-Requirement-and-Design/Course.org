** UML (Unified Modeling Diagram) PDF
** Information Systems
System to be used my the an organization to achieve some task which may be also used in desision making.
It has the following components
- Hardware
- Software
- Database
- Network
- Process
** Layers of Software Engineering
1. Process
   It is a set of activity actions and tasks in order to make a product.
   - activity : are fixed.
   - actions : are when followed make a specific thing.
   - task : is done to achieve a specific goal.
2. Process frame work : A small numeber of activity that can be done on all the software.
   communication -> planning -> modeling -> desing -> construct -> deploy
3. Methods (SDLC)
4. Tools
5. A quality approach
** Software Process Structure
Activities that are used to design, implement and testing of software.
** Activity
**** Activity Diagram
**** Actor
**** Action
** Patterns
Repeated treds
**** Design Patterns
** Process Models
**** Linear Model
**** Iterative Model
**** Evolutionary Model
**** Paralle Model

** The five main framework activities
They are universal processes
- Communication
- Planning
- Modeling
- Construction
- Deployment
** Enterprise Artitect
A software to build shit, jira and devops kinda stuff
** Process Flows
- Linear
- Iterative
- Evolutionary Model
- Parallel Flow
** Process Models
- Linear Seqential
- Prototyping model
- Rapid Application Development
- Evolutionary Process Model
- Spiral Model
- WINWIN Spiral
- Concurrent Model
- Component Base Development

** Uml
Unified Modeling Language
** System Modeling
Drawing an abstract model of a system by using diagrams.
It is graphical.
It helps to communicate with the client.
It is a part of "Requirement Engineering Process".
**** Activity Diagram
**** Use Case Diagram
**** Sequence Diagram
**** Class Diagram
**** State Diagram

** Requirement Engineering
Requirements engineering (RE)[1] is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining requirements[2] in the engineering design process. It is a common role in systems engineering and software engineering.
It is the first step of sdlc process.
*** Requirement
A requirement is condidtion or a skill that a user needs to solve.
*** Perpouse of requirement
- Assesment
- Customer expectation
- Project planing
- Setting scope
*** Classification of Requirement
**** Process Requirement
Cost markiting, Process, salse and distribution
**** Product Requirement
Consists of functional and non-funtional requirement.
It can be from either dev's or user's pov.

** Problem with RE
- Unclear Objectives
- Communication Problem
- Language Barrier
- Knowledge barriers
- Vague formulation ( bad logic )
- Too formal formulation
- Instability
- Bad Quality
- User incoicment
- Overlook requirement
- In accurate planning
  Minimal specification
** Quality
- Necessay
- Feasible
- Correct
- Concise
- Unambigous
- Complete
- Consistant
- Verification
- Traceable
- Allocated
- Design
- No redundancy
- Written using standards
- Assined to a unique identifier
- Devoid Of Classes
** Priorty
- Commitment
- Fault
- Urgercy
- Evaluation of risk
** Requirement Management
Include processes for identification and management or requirement
*** standards for it
- ISO 9000
- ISO 9126
- IEEE 610
- IEEE 830
- IEEE 1233
*** reason why it is negleted
*** Possible consequences
* [2024-09-23 Mon] - Requirement Engineering Process
** Requiement Engineering process
It is an activity in which you go back and forth. In which we identify the vasic ingrediants to make the products.
It is an iterative process.
Reqirement distilation us the process of making requirement pure.
*** Elicitation, Analysis or discovery
Work with the client to see what they need. All the steak-holder are involved.
It is a iterative
It gives us a timeline for the project
**** Problem of requirement engineering
- Stakeholders don't know what they want
- They express their own term.
**** Techniques
- Interview
  - Open or closed ended
- Questioanre
- Sinarios
  - The best course of action is to see the manual of the companies
*** Validation
*** Management
