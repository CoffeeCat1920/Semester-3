** UML (Unified Modeling Diagram) PDF
** Information Systems
System to be used my the an organization to achieve some task which may be also used in desision making.
It has the following components
- Hardware
- Software
- Data base
- Network
- Process
** Layers of Software Engineering
1. Process
   It is a set of activity actions and tasks in order to make a product.
   - activity : are fixed.
   - actions : are when followed make a specific thing.
   - task : is done to achieve a specific goal.
2. Process frame work : A small numeber of activity that can be done on all the software.
   communication -> planning -> modeling -> desing -> construct -> deploy
3. Methods (SDLC)
4. Tools
5. A quality approach
** Software Process Structure
Activities that are used to design, implement and testing of software.
** Activity
**** Activity Diagram
**** Actor
**** Action
** Patterns
Repeated treds
**** Design Patterns
** Process Models
**** Linear Model
**** Iterative Model
**** Evolutionary Model
**** Paralle Model

** The five main framework activities
They are universal processes
- Communication
- Planning
- Modeling
- Construction
- Deployment
** Enterprise Artitect
A software to build shit, jira and devops kinda stuff
** Process Flows
- Linear
- Iterative
- Evolutionary Model
- Parallel Flow
** Process Modes
- Linear Seqential
- Prototyping model
- Rapid Application Development
- Evolutionary Process Model
- Spiral Model
- WINWIN Spiral
- Concurrent Model
- Component Base Development

** Uml
Unified Modeling Language
** System Modeling
Drawing an abstract model of a system by using diagrams.
It is graphical.
It helps to communicate with the client.
It is a part of "Requirement Engineering Process".
**** Activity Diagram
**** Use Case Diagram
**** Sequence Diagram
**** Class Diagram
**** State Diagram

** Requirement Engineering
Requirements engineering (RE)[1] is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining requirements[2] in the engineering design process. It is a common role in systems engineering and software engineering.
It is the first step of sdlc process.
*** Requirement
A requirement is condidtion or a skill that a user needs to solve.
*** Perpouse of requirement
- Assesment
- Customer expectation
- Project planing
- Setting scope
*** Classification of Requirement
**** Process Requirement
Cost markiting, Process, salse and distribution
**** Product Requirement
Consists of functional and non-funtional requirement.
It can be from either dev's or user's pov.

** Problem with RE
- Unclear Objectives
- Communication Problem
- Language Barrier
- Knowledge barriers
- Vague formulation ( bad logic )
- Too formal formulation
- Instability
- Bad Quality
- User incoicment
- Overlook requirement
- In accurate planning
  Minimal specification
** Quality
- Necessay
- Feasible
- Correct
- Concise
- Unambigous
- Complete
- Consistant
- Verification
- Traceable
- Allocated
- Design
- No redundancy
- Written using standards
- Assined to a unique identifier
- Devoid Of Classes
** Priorty
- Commitment
- Fault
- Urgercy
- Evaluation of risk
** Requirement Management
Include processes for identification and management or requirement
*** standards for it
- ISO 9000
- ISO 9126
- IEEE 610
- IEEE 830
- IEEE 1233
*** reason why it is negleted
*** Possible consequences
( there is a quiz on Moday and Wednesday is assignment day )
